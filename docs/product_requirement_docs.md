# Product Requirement Document: Local File Converter v1.0

## 1. Overview / Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for building a premier, privacy-focused online file conversion tool. The core principle and unique selling proposition of this application is that all file conversions MUST happen locally within the user's browser, utilizing client-side technologies (JavaScript and WebAssembly). No user files will be uploaded to any server for conversion, ensuring maximum user privacy and data security.

The long-term vision is to support thousands of conversion types, but the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on delivering 10 core, common conversion types flawlessly.

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### 2.1. Goals

- **G1 (Core):** Perform all file conversions entirely on the client-side (in the user's browser).
- **G2 (Privacy):** Ensure user files and data are never transmitted to a server for processing.
- **G3 (Security):** Minimize security risks by eliminating server-side file handling vulnerabilities.
- **G4 (Performance):** Strive to be the fastest possible client-side file converter through optimization, primarily leveraging WebAssembly.
- **G5 (User Experience):** Provide the simplest, cleanest, and most intuitive user interface possible.
- **G6 (MVP Scope):** Implement the 10 specific conversion pairs listed in Appendix A flawlessly.
- **G7 (Scalability):** Build a modular architecture capable of supporting thousands of conversion types in the future.

### 2.2. Non-Goals (for MVP v1.0)

- Server-side file conversion processing or fallbacks.
- User accounts, registration, or profiles.
- Storing user files on a server (even temporarily).
- Cloud storage integration (e.g., converting files directly from Google Drive/Dropbox).
- Advanced file editing features beyond simple conversion.
- Specific compliance adherence (e.g., WCAG AA) - This is a goal for future versions.
- Support for browsers older than the latest 2 versions of major evergreen browsers.

## 3. Target Audience

General internet users across various platforms (desktop, mobile) who need a quick, secure, and private way to convert common file formats.

## 4. Key Features (MVP Scope - v1.0)

The MVP MUST deliver the following core functionality, supporting only the 10 conversion pairs listed in Appendix A:

- **F1:** User interface for file selection (Drag-and-drop and browse button).
- **F2:** User interface for selecting the target output format from the available MVP conversions.
- **F3:** Client-side file reading and size validation (up to 100MB limit).
- **F4:** Client-side file conversion logic execution (via JS/WASM in Web Workers) for the 10 specified MVP pairs.
- **F5:** Real-time progress indication during conversion.
- **F6:** Generation of a download link for the locally converted file.
- **F7:** Clear error handling and messaging.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Massive expansion of supported conversion formats (target: thousands).
- Batch conversion capabilities.
- Basic image/media editing options (crop, resize, trim).
- User-configurable conversion settings (e.g., quality, bitrate).
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features.
- Compliance with standards like WCAG 2.1 AA.
- More sophisticated file type detection (MIME types, magic numbers).

## Appendix A: MVP Conversion List (v1.0)

The following 10 conversion pairs MUST be implemented flawlessly for the MVP release:

1.  PDF -> DOCX
2.  DOCX -> PDF
3.  JPG -> PNG
4.  PNG -> JPG
5.  HEIC -> JPG
6.  JPG -> PDF (Single JPG to single-page PDF)
7.  PNG -> PDF (Single PNG to single-page PDF; support transparency)
8.  MP4 -> MP3
9.  PDF -> JPG (Single page or user selection of page range to multiple JPGs)
10. MOV -> MP4
11. MP4 -> GIF (Consider basic options like resolution/framerate)
