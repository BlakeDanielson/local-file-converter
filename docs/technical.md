# Technical Details: Local File Converter v1.0

## 1. Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** React (Latest stable version)
- **Core Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **High-Performance Processing:** WebAssembly (WASM)
  - Source: Compiled from C/C++/Rust using tools like Emscripten or wasm-pack.
  - Responsibility: Team to source, evaluate, compile (if needed), and integrate WASM libraries.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Web Workers API
- **File Handling:** HTML5 File API (FileReader, Blob, File objects)
- **Build Tool:** Vite or Webpack (Team preference - requires config for React, WASM, Workers)
- **Styling:** CSS Modules, Styled-components, or Tailwind CSS (Team preference - focus on maintainability)
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Allowed, but require team vetting (suitability, performance, security, license).
- **Hosting:** Static web hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3+CloudFront, GitHub Pages).

## 2. Performance Requirements & Considerations

- **Goal:** Aim for the "fastest possible" client-side conversion (subjective, no specific v1.0 benchmarks).
- **Optimization Strategies:**
  - Profile and optimize WASM execution.
  - Minimize data copying between main thread and workers (use transferable objects).
  - Efficient memory management (revoke object URLs promptly).
  - Lazy-load conversion modules.
- **Limitations:** Acknowledge performance variance based on user hardware/browser, especially for large/complex files (within 100MB limit).

## 3. Security Requirements

- **Primary Mechanism:** Local processing (no server uploads).
- **Transport:** MUST use HTTPS.
- **Mitigation:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Vetting:** All 3rd-party JS/WASM libraries MUST be vetted (vulnerabilities, licenses).
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Be mindful of potential browser DoS from malicious files during conversion; implement safeguards (e.g., timeouts) if possible within libraries.

## 4. Browser Support

- Target latest 2 stable versions of:
  - Google Chrome
  - Mozilla Firefox
  - Microsoft Edge
  - Apple Safari
- No support required for older versions or Internet Explorer.

## 5. Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing:** Mandatory for JS/React components/utilities (high coverage).
- **Integration Testing:** Required for component, main thread, and worker interactions.
- **E2E Testing:** Recommended for core conversion workflows.
- **Manual QA:** Performed by Project Owner.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Required across supported browsers.

## 6. Open Issues / Risks

- **Risk:** High complexity/effort for finding/building/integrating reliable & performant WASM for diverse MVP conversions. Feasibility needs validation (esp. PDF<->DOCX).
- **Risk:** "Fastest" performance goal is subjective and depends on WASM quality and user hardware.
- **Risk:** Undefined timeline/budget impacts prioritization and MVP scope delivery. Requires iterative planning.
- **Open Issue:** Need list of 50+ post-MVP conversion pairs to inform scalable architecture.
