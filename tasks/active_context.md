# Active Context: Local File Converter

**Date:** 2025-04-20 (Phase 2 In Progress)

**Current Status:**

- Project initialization complete.
- Core memory files (`docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, `tasks/active_context.md`) have been created and populated based on the initial Technical Specification v1.0.
- Phase 1 (Setup & Core UI) implementation complete.
  - **All tasks completed:**
    - [x] **Setup-1:** Initialized React project using Webpack as the build tool.
    - [x] **Setup-2:** Configured Webpack for WASM and Web Worker support.
    - [x] **Setup-3:** Integrated styling solution (switched from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI library).
    - [x] **Setup-4:** Implemented basic application layout/shell.
    - [x] **UI-1 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Drag-and-drop area).
    - [x] **UI-2 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Browse button - `<input type="file">`).
    - [x] **UI-3 (F2):** Implemented UI for selecting target output format (dynamically populated).
    - [x] **UI-4 (F5):** Implemented basic UI for progress indication (placeholder for spinner/percentage).
    - [x] **UI-5 (F6):** Implemented UI element to display/trigger download link.
    - [x] **UI-6 (F7):** Implemented basic UI area for displaying error messages.
    - [x] **Core-1 (F3):** Implemented client-side file reading (metadata) via File API.
    - [x] **Core-2 (F3):** Implemented client-side file size validation (< 100MB).
    - [x] **Core-3:** Implemented basic Web Worker setup and communication channel (main thread <-> worker).
    - [x] **Core-4 (F7):** Implemented initial error handling framework.

- Phase 2 (Conversion Implementation) in progress:
  - **Completed:**
    - [x] Created modular worker architecture with base class and factory pattern
    - [x] Implemented image conversion worker for JPG ↔ PNG conversions using Canvas API
    - [x] Set up ConversionService as the main interface for file conversions
  - **In Progress:**
    - [ ] Research and evaluate libraries for document conversions (PDF ↔ DOCX)
    - [ ] Research and evaluate libraries for media conversions (MP4/MOV/MP3/GIF)
    - [ ] Research and evaluate libraries for HEIC conversion

**Current Focus:**

- Continuing Phase 2 implementation by adding support for additional file conversions.
- Implementing document conversion with a focus on PDF ↔ DOCX conversions.

**Next Steps:**

1. Research and evaluate PDF.js and docx.js libraries for document conversions.
2. Implement document conversion worker using the selected libraries.
3. Research and evaluate ffmpeg.wasm for media conversions.
4. Implement media conversion worker for audio/video formats.
5. Research and evaluate heic-decode library for HEIC → JPG conversions.

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- **Worker Architecture:** Implemented a modular worker architecture with:
  - BaseConversionWorker abstract class for common functionality
  - Specialized worker implementations for different file types
  - WorkerFactory for managing worker instances
  - ConversionService as a clean interface for the application
- **Image Conversion:** Using Canvas API for JPG ↔ PNG conversions (lightweight, no external dependencies)
- **Progress Reporting:** Standardized progress reporting from workers to UI

**Implementation Details:**

- Created an extensible architecture that allows for adding new conversion types
- Implemented real-time progress updates from workers
- Standardized error handling and reporting

**Open Considerations:**

- Evaluating different WASM libraries for document, media, and special format conversions
- Considering lazy loading of conversion workers to reduce initial load time
