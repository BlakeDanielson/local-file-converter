# Active Context: Local File Converter

**Date:** 2025-04-18 (Phase 1 Implementation)

**Current Status:**

- Project initialization complete.
- Core memory files (`docs/product_requirement_docs.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/technical.md`, `tasks/tasks_plan.md`, `tasks/active_context.md`) have been created and populated based on the initial Technical Specification v1.0.
- Phase 1 (Setup & Core UI) implementation started.
  - **Completed:**
    - [x] **Setup-1:** Initialized React project using Webpack as the build tool.
    - [x] **Setup-2:** Configured Webpack for WASM and Web Worker support.
    - [x] **Setup-3:** Integrated CSS Modules as the styling solution.
    - [x] **UI-1 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Drag-and-drop area).
    - [x] **UI-2 (F1):** Implemented file selection UI (Browse button - `<input type="file">`).
    - [x] **Core-1 (F3):** Implemented client-side file reading (metadata) via File API.
    - [x] **Core-2 (F3):** Implemented client-side file size validation (< 100MB).
    - [x] **Core-3:** Implemented basic Web Worker setup and communication channel (main thread <-> worker).
    - [x] **Core-4 (F7):** Implemented initial error handling framework.

**Current Focus:**

- Completing remaining Phase 1 tasks:
  - **UI-3 (F2):** Implement UI for selecting target output format (dynamically populated).
  - **UI-4 (F5):** Implement basic UI for progress indication (placeholder for spinner/percentage).
  - **UI-5 (F6):** Implement UI element to display/trigger download link.
  - **UI-6 (F7):** Implement basic UI area for displaying error messages.

**Next Steps:**

1. Implement UI for target format selection based on input file type.
2. Implement progress indicator component.
3. Implement download link UI and functionality.
4. Enhance error message displays.

**Technical Decisions Made:**

- **Build Tool:** Webpack (chosen for its flexibility and support for complex configuration needs).
- **Styling Solution:** CSS Modules (chosen for component-scoped styles without runtime overhead).
- **Data Flow:** State is maintained in the App component and passed down to child components.
- **Worker Communication:** Using Web Worker API with typed message patterns.

**Open Considerations:**

- Begin research/vetting for WASM libraries for the MVP conversion pairs (to be done alongside finishing Phase 1).
